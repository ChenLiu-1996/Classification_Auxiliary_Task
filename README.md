# Alternative Auxiliary Task for Image Classification
Chen Liu

Image reconstruction has long been treated as a valid and effective auxiliary task to facilitate the learning of useful and meaningful features for image classification. We are re-thinking this paradigm to see if we can use other auxiliary tasks that either emperically yields better performances on the primary task (classification), or poses different constraints on the learning process.

Please feel free to use this repository as you like to do your own experiments, try out other auxiliary tasks, test on different primary tasks, etc.
